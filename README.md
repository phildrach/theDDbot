# theDDbot
This is a bot I have created for reddit.com/r/robinhoodpennystocks

In recent months, small cap stocks have gained momentum among retail traders, and subreddits with a focus
in this area have received an influx of new users.

These small cap stocks are often subject to "pump and dump" schemes. This bot was created in response to 
other bots having been created to pump volume into a stock. They do this by using the Reddit platform to
reach a broad number of retail traders looking for valuable stock position prospects.

For this reason, many new accounts with low 'karma' are considered to be shady. This bot will automatically
reply to any redditor posting research/due dilligence ("DD") to the subreddit with their account's creation
date, and karma level.

Therefore, other redditors can use this information to determine how trustworthy the original poster might be
